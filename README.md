# HousingPricePredictions
Predicting housing prices in San Francisco using a number of machine learning algorithms.

- HousingPrices: Start with this notebook. We review the data, perform some inital review and as well as feature engineering, then run many of the most popular machine learning algorithms on the data.

- HousingPrices-SparkML: Taking the poject above and transforming it into a Spark ML project. Documented here: https://towardsdatascience.com/from-scikit-learn-to-spark-ml-f2886fb46852

- HousingPricesKeras: The same data and predictions, but specifically with the Keras deep learning library.

- HousingPricesXGBoost: The same as above, but using XGBoost.
